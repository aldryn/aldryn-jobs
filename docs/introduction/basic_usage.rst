Basic usage

Create a django CMS page to hook the Aldryn Jobs application into. In its
*Advanced settings*, set its ``Application`` to *Jobs*, and use the provided
default *Jobs / aldryn_jobs* in ``Application configurations`` before saving.

The page is now a landing page for job openings; it will be empty until you
create some.

Also in *Advanced settings*, you may choose to attach one of two menus as a
sub-menu to the page in the site navigation: the *Job Categories Menu* or
the *Job Openings Menu*. No menu is attached automatically.

The behaviour of the Jobs system should be largely self-explanatory, but the
:doc:`tutorial for users </user/index>` will guide you through some basic steps
if necessary.
